            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> - In the Bhutan Baccalaureate, I’ve experienced how important mentorship is. My mentor and I along with my co-mentees have built a trusting, supportive relationship where we learn from each other. Through our time together, I receive guidance in both my academic and personal growth, and it created a strong sense of community between us working toward shared goals.</li>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kinzang Choden, and I am currently studying in the ninth grade. I am from Mongar, a place that has played an important role in shaping my personality and values. In my family, I have three siblings including me, and I am the eldest one. Being the oldest has taught me responsibility, patience, and the importance of setting a good example for my younger siblings.

During my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, and painting. These hobbies allow me to express my creativity and explore new ideas. </p>
